Simple Bank System
This project is a simple Bank System implemented in Java. It allows users to:

Create an account
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Project Overview
The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It covers the following OOP principles:

Classes and Objects: Defining and instantiating classes to model the bank system.
Methods: Using methods to perform actions like creating an account, depositing, and withdrawing money.
Encapsulation: Using getters and setters to access and modify private fields.
Features
Create Account: Users can create a new bank account.
Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account.
Future Improvements
I plan to enhance this project by adding more features and improving the existing codebase. Some potential improvements include:

Adding support for multiple accounts
Implementing account validation and error handling
Adding a user-friendly interface
Expanding the project to include more banking operations
